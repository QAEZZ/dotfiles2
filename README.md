Fonts needed:
```

Install it via the [AUR](https://security.archlinux.org/package/ttf-firacode-nerd) using your favorite AUR helper. \
Ex. `yay`: 
```sh
$ yay -S ttf-firacode-nerd
```

There are a shit load of other dependencies needed, I'll update this README later on as the rice isn't fully done. \
This rice is for Arch.

- [ ] any other shit I feel like.
